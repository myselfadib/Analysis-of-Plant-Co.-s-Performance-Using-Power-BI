## Overview 
This repository contains a Power BI project dedicated to analyzing the 2023 performance of Plant Co. by reviewing sales and gross profit across various product categories and markets. It is designed to facilitate strategic decision-making through in-depth examination of year-to-date data and trend comparisons across multiple dimensions.

## Objective 
The primary aim of this project is to provide actionable insights and highlight key performance metrics that support data-driven decisions at Plant Co., focusing on areas where operational adjustments can enhance profitability.

## Key Findings and Insights:

- Sales Trends: There was a YTD total sales decrease of 3.8%, with sales peaking notably during March, April, and November due to focused marketing efforts on indoor products.
- Gross Profit Analysis: Despite an overall gross profit drop of $265.3K from the previous year, targeted months showed resilience with slight profit gains, presenting an opportunity to optimize sales strategies during these periods.
- Regional Performance: Significant declines were recorded in key markets such as China, Sweden, and France, pointing to a need for revitalized sales strategies in these regions.
- Product Performance: Indoor products outperformed landscape and outdoor products, suggesting a potential realignment of product focus to boost overall sales figures.

## Strategic Recommendations:
- Resource Allocation: Redirect resources towards high-performing indoor products to potentially increase overall sales by 5%.
- Market Strategy Overhaul: Implement targeted interventions in underperforming regions to achieve up to a 10% improvement in sales, which could mitigate the current YTD decline.
- Profitability Optimization: Re-evaluate low-performing accounts and focus on segments with higher profitability to boost the gross profit margin from 39.6% to as much as 42%.

## Tools and Techniques Used:
- Data Analysis: Utilized DAX for complex year-over-year growth calculations and performance metrics.
- Visualization: Developed dynamic dashboards with interactive elements like slicers and conditional formatting to facilitate in-depth trend analysis and cross-regional comparison.
- Strategic Insights: Employed data segmentation and profitability analysis to derive actionable strategies for business improvement.
